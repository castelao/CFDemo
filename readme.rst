A Hands on Tutorial on CF-Conventions
=====================================

The goal here is to show real-world use cases of CF-Conventions so it could help new users interested in implementing CF in their data. 
This material cannot replace the CF-Conventions documentation, but hopefully, it will help to convince that adopt CF is a good thing and give some sense before reading the details in the official documentation.

In a CF meeting, Kevin O'Brien raised the issue that many groups around the world do not have the expertise on handling netCDF, so Kevin suggested the idea of creating a notebook explaining step by step on how to create a netCDF-CF dataset.
I'm not sure yet which direction we are going here. 
My suggestion is to create notebooks with real use cases, including the decision steps. 
I'll start with a notebook for underwater gliders and let's see how it develops. Ideally, we would build a collection of notebooks covering different types of data, so that a new user might find a case closer to what is needed.
